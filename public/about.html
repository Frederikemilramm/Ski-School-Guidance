                Founded by two passionate ski enthusiasts, Ski School Guidance is the result of a shared love for skiing and adventure. Our journey began on the slopes, and over the years, our passion grew into a mission: helping others discover the joy of skiing. We believe that skiing is not just a sport—it's an experience that brings people closer to nature and themselves.
